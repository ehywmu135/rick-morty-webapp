▶ How to Run the Project
1. Run the Backend (.NET)
cd rick-morty-server
dotnet run


Server runs at:

http://localhost:5269


Endpoints:

GET /test

GET /api/character

GET /api/character/{id}

2. Run the Frontend (Angular)
cd rick-morty-client
ng serve


Client runs at:

http://localhost:4200

Architecture & Methodology
1. Separation of Concerns

Component → UI only

Service → API calls + data access

Model → Strong typing

Routing → Navigation logic

This keeps the code clean, testable, and readable.

2. Reactive Programming with RxJS

The service returns Observable streams

Components subscribe and update UI reactively

Episode loading uses forkJoin for parallel HTTP calls

3. Standalone Components (Angular 17+)

Eliminates heavy module structure.
Each component declares its own imports → improves maintainability.

Backend API Documentation
GET /api/character

Returns the full character response from Rick & Morty API.

GET /api/character/{id}

Returns one character by ID.
